# Project of Algorithm and Data Structure 2022 of Polythechnic of Milan
## The score of this project was 24/30 
In my opinion was a very well designed project, but the main issue was an error in the production of a particular output and I hadn't time to fix it
But still I'm quiet happy witht the overall result, but the process of developing it was painful.
Actually I really liked the design part and it was so interesting that I spent days thinkng of how I should build the entire system and all the important function, in order to minimize the time complexity and the space complexity.
But then the implementation part was really though and got me very discouraged.
Now, I think that was very useful, at least to start understanding what are the moral issue when carrying on such a detailed program
